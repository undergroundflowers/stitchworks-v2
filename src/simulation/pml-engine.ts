/**
 * PML simulation engine — discrete-event simulator for the Process Modeling
 * Library graph in a Stitchworks twin.
 *
 * Tier-1 block coverage (all the demo factory needs to run end-to-end):
 *   • Source         — generates agents at a constant per-hour rate
 *   • Sink           — destroys agents, captures lead time
 *   • Queue          — FIFO buffer between blocks
 *   • Service        — Seize → Delay → Release, draws from the dept's
 *                      ResourcePool sum (implicit binding for v1)
 *   • SelectOutput   — probabilistic pass / fail router (drives QC)
 *   • ResourcePool   — capacity contributor; not in the flow itself
 *   • Conveyor       — treated as a fixed-time Delay (v1)
 *
 * Other PML kinds (Delay, Hold, Wait, Batch, Unbatch, Combine, Match,
 * Assembler, Split, MoveTo, Seize/Release standalone, SelectOutput5)
 * fall through to a degenerate pass-through in v1: they accept an agent
 * and forward it on the first output port immediately. This keeps a
 * partial graph runnable while we extend coverage in follow-up turns.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   • One MinHeap of timestamped events (priority queue keyed by sim time).
 *   • Push semantics — when an agent leaves a block, it is delivered
 *     immediately to the target block's `accept(...)`.
 *   • Each block has its own internal queue for back-pressure.
 *   • Time unit is **minutes** throughout (matches the legacy engine and
 *     the IE-friendly "/hr" KPIs the rest of the app speaks).
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no zustand — pure logic so it's testable and reusable
 * by any caller (the Builder runner, future LiveSim, future replication
 * harness, future export).

 *    2. Op-bulletin SMV × bundleSize — when the workstation is bound to a
 *       garment operation (typical for pilot-factory lines). Each engine
 *       "agent" carries one bundle, so the cycle is `smv × bundleSize`
 *       minutes per agent. Without this lookup, every sewing workstation

 *       machine), which makes Line 1 and Line 2 run at identical tempo
 *       regardless of which garment they're stitching.
 *    3. Catalog `cycle_s` / `capacity_per_hr` / 30s hard default.
 *
 *  Finally we apply `shareFactor` — when one operator is shared across N
 *  stations, each station only sees the operator (1/N)·shift, so its
 *  effective cycle time is multiplied by N (i.e. divided by shareFactor).
